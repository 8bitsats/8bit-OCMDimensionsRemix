# OCM Dimensions

Bitcoin Ordinals has an important purpose for humanity, and that is to enable 
an open decentralized and immutable platform for people to publish and secure
their work for a long time. However, the total amount of block space is limited, at 
most around 200 Gigabytes/year.

Tools are needed to allow all the important inscriptions to be created on Bitcoin.
OCM Dimension is an generative art collection of high quality 3D art, efficiently stored 
on Bitcoin. And it is art as a tool that enables others to create on Bitcoin, using
the Dimensions art itself.

Dimension enables future creators to compress their work, thus saving space and
allowing creators to inscribe more data. Enabling compression that is native to inscriptions
is very powerful for creators. No change in the Ordinal protocol is needed! It works today.
It works because the decompression algorithem is inscribed in the Dimensions art.

Dimensions also enables these additional features.

Anyone can create with the three.js library, and it's all on-chain on Bitcoin because the three.js
library was inscribed in the Dimensions art. 

Anyone can create with the p5.js library, and it's all on-chain because p5.js was compressed and
inscribed by Dimensions and can be called on through the Dimensions art.

Future js libraries can also be added on-chain in the same way and enabled for future 
inscriptions.
